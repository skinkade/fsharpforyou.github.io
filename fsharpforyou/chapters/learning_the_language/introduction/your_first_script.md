# Your First Script

There are a couple of ways we can run `F#` code.
We can begin by writing an F# script file.
Scripts are an easy way to learn and toy around with the language or to execute code in a standalone manner.

First, create a file named `MyScript.fsx`.

```fsharp
printfn "Hello world!"
```

We can run this script by executing `dotnet fsi MyScript.fsx` or pressing `Alt + Enter` with Ionide + Visual Studio Code.
Incredible. Do you feel the power coursing through your veins?
