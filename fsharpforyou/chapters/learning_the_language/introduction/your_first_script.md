# Your First Script

There are a couple of ways we can run `F#` code.
We can begin by writing an F# script file, which has the extension `.fsx`.
Scripts are an easy way to learn and toy around with the language or to execute code in a standalone manner.

First, create a file named `MyScript.fsx`, containing the following:

```fsharp
printfn "Hello world!"
```

We can run this script by executing `dotnet fsi MyScript.fsx`, or by
highlighting the code in VS Code and pressing `Alt + Enter` on
Windows/Linux, or `Option + Enter` on macOS. Incredible. Do you feel
the power coursing through your veins?
