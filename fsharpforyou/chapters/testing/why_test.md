# Why testing is important

Testing ensures that our software behaves in expected ways and can find bugs and performance issues before they go to production.
Testing also serves as documentation of expected behavior and functionality for developers who are looking at our code.
Testing also ensures that we can refactor safely without worrying if our changes break any existing behavior and that current expectations are met.
