# Installing

First, you have to install [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

Once you've done that, you're done! You've installed .NET and are ready to use F#! Wow!

For editors, we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp) extension.

You're more than welcome to use any editor that strikes your fancy. Except maybe not Microsoft Word.
