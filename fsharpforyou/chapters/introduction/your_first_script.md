# Your First Script

There are a couple of ways we can run `F#` code.
We can begin by writing an F# script file.
Scripts are an easy way to learn and toy around with the language or to execute code in a standalone manner.

First, create a file named `MyScript.fsx`.

```fsharp
printfn "Hello world!"
```

We can run this script by executing `dotnet fsi MyScript.fsx`.
Incredible. Do you feel the power coursing through your veins?

For most of these examples. We recommend you stick with `.fsx` scripts.
