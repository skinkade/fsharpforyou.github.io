# Conditional Expressions
Conditional expressions are expressions that evaluate a boolean value (true or false)
and evaluate a branch of code if that condition yields a `true` value: `if X do Y, else do Z`
*)

let outputAge age =
  if age >= 18 then printfn "You are an adult!"
  else printfn "You are not an adult!"

(**
This reads as:
if age is greater then or equal to 18, `printfn "You are an adult"`   
otherwise, `printfn "You are not an adult!"`
*)

outputAge 23 // is greater than 18
outputAge 15 // is NOT greater than 18
(*** include-output ***)

(**
All branches of a conditional expression must return values of the same type, which is inferred from the return value of the first branch (or optionally, the type annotation).
If the first branch returns a `string` value, the second branch cannot return a `unit` value as `unit` is not convertible to `string`.
This code will result in a compiler error:
```fsharp
let outputAge' age =
  if age >= 18 then "Adult" // <- string value
  else () // <- unit value
```
*)
