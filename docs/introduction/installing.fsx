# Installing F#
First, you have to install `.NET`. Follow the directions here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Once you've done that, you're done! You've installed `F#`! Wow!

For editors, we recommend `VS Code` with the `Ionide` extension.

You're more than welcome to use any editor that strikes your fancy. Except maybe not Microsoft Word.

## Our first program
There are a couple of ways we can run `F#` code.
To open an interactive session where we can enter code and have it immediately evaluated,
fire up your friendly local command prompt and type `dotnet fsi`.
Once you're jacked in, do the following:
*)

printfn "Hello world!";;

Incredible. Do you feel the power coursing through your veins?

Type a few more things just to get your adrenaline flowing.

Make sure to include the `;;` at the end. This won't be required in
regular `F#` code, but is important to tell the interactive session
we're ready to be evaluated.
*)

let numbers = [ 0..99 ];;
(*** include-value: numbers ***)

List.sum numbers;;
(*** include-it ***)

To exit the interpreter, type `#quit;;` and hit enter OR press `Ctrl D`.
